<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

We make ourselves a place apart <br>
   &nbsp;  Behind light words that tease and flout, <br>
But oh, the agitated heart <br>
&nbsp; Till someone find us really out. <br><br>

'Tis pity if the case require <br>
&nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end <br>
We speak the literal to inspire <br>
&nbsp; The understanding of a friend. <br> <br>

But so with all, from babes that play <br>
&nbsp; At hide-and-seek to God afar, <br>
So all who hide too well away <br>
&nbsp;  Must speak and tell us there they are. <br>
